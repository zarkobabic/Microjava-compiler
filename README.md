## Overview

This repository hosts the source code and documentation for the **MicroJava Compiler**, a Java-based compiler for the **MicroJava** programming language. MicroJava is a small, educational programming language, and this compiler is designed to convert MicroJava source code into bytecode that can be executed on the MicroJava Runtime Machine.

## Project Components

The MicroJava Compiler consists of four primary components:

1. **Lexer**:
   - Implemented using [jFlex](https://jflex.de/), the lexer analyzes the source code and tokenizes it based on the MicroJava language specification. It identifies and classifies language constructs, such as keywords, operators, and identifiers. This lexer is a crucial initial step in the compilation process.

2. **Parser**:
   - Implemented using [CUP](http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/), the parser takes the tokenized output from the lexer and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) following the MicroJava language specification. It enforces the language's syntax rules, ensuring that the source code adheres to the correct structure and order of statements and expressions.

3. **Syntax Analysis**:
   - In this phase, the AST generated by the parser is analyzed to enforce the constraints of the MicroJava language. Syntax analysis ensures that the code follows the correct grammar, handles operator precedence, type checking, and validates the program's structure.

4. **Code Generation**:
   - The final phase of the compiler is responsible for generating executable bytecode for the MicroJava Runtime Machine. This process translates the validated AST into instructions that can be executed on the MicroJava virtual machine, enabling the execution of MicroJava programs.

## Lexing in General

Lexing, also known as tokenization, is the process of breaking down the source code into a stream of tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of a programming language and include keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. The lexer's role is to recognize and classify these tokens based on the language's grammar and rules.

## Parsing in General

Parsing is a crucial step in the compilation process that follows lexing. It involves the analysis of the tokenized source code to determine its structure and relationships between different elements. In this phase, a parser constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the program's syntax according to the language's grammar. It enforces the correct order of statements, expressions, and the overall program structure.


## Syntax Analysis in General

Syntax analysis, also known as parsing, is an essential part of any compiler. It ensures that the source code adheres to the rules and grammar of the target programming language. During this phase, the compiler constructs a structured representation of the code (such as an AST) and performs various checks to ensure correctness. Common tasks in syntax analysis include identifying and reporting syntax errors, handling operator precedence, and building a representation of the program that can be used for further processing and code generation.

## Code Generation in General

Code generation is the final phase of a compiler, responsible for producing executable code from the parsed and analyzed source code. During this phase, the compiler generates code that can be executed on the target platform, such as machine code or bytecode. The generated code should adhere to the rules and specifications of the target platform and be semantically equivalent to the original source code.

## Usage

The MicroJava Compiler can be used by students and educators as a learning tool for understanding the principles of compiler construction. To build and use the compiler, please refer to the instructions provided in the repository's documentation.
